# AI-Agent
 An AI agent is a software entity that utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to perform tasks autonomously, or with minimal human intervention. These agents can perceive their environment through sensors, reason about the information they gather, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

Key characteristics of AI agents include:

1. **Autonomy**: They can operate independently and make decisions without human input.
2. **Reactivity**: They can respond to changes in their environment in real-time.
3. **Proactiveness**: They can take initiative to fulfill goals or improve their own performance.
4. **Social ability**: They can interact with other agents and humans, often communicating and collaborating to achieve complex tasks.

AI agents can be found in various applications, such as virtual personal assistants (like Siri or Alexa), self-driving cars, gaming NPCs (non-player characters), and robotic systems.


This project AI-Agent aims to build anAI Agent similar to DeepWiki that can answer queries about your repository.
